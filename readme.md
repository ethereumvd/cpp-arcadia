# ðŸŽ® CPP - Arcadia

A small collection of classic games and visualizations built with **[raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)**:

| Folder | Game / Demo |
| ------ | ----------- | 
| `pong/` | Pong | 
| `snake/` | Snake | 
| `tetris/` | Tetris | 
| `conwaysâ€‘gameâ€‘ofâ€‘life/` | Conwayâ€™s Game of Life | 

All four projects share the same toolchain and build together with **CMake** into a single `build/bin/` directory.

- **Oneâ€‘command build** via CMake â‰¥â€¯3.15  
- Organized source / header layout per game
